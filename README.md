# Visual Studio Code Setup
![Settings Preview](./settings_preview.png)

This is a backup of my Visual Studio Code [settings](./settings.json) and keyboard bindings ([Windows](./keybindings/windows/keybindings.json), [macOS](./keybindings/macos/keybindings.json)) to easily share with others, and for myself in case sync fails ðŸ™ƒ
